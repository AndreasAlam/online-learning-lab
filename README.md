# Jelinek Summer School - Machine Learning Lab

## Summary

This three hour lab was designed for the 2017 Jelinek Summer School at
Carnegie Mellon University. Students will learn about the efficient
implementation of online learning (i.e. stochastic gradient descent)
through a choose-your-own-adventure style exercise. The task is
language identification; two datasets are provided. A very basic
implementation of streaming multinomial logistic regression is
improved to near state-of-the-art performance.
